## Coordinate Practice Interview Sessions

Consulting is an extremely competitive field. Potential candidates often have a strong background in academics, extracurricular activities and work experience. Interviews are conducted by employers to allow candidates to differentiate themselves. Consulting firms often include both a standard, <a href="https://alis.alberta.ca/ep/eps/tips/tips.html?EK=161" target="_blank">behavioural interview</a> and an industry specific, <a href="http://www.insideconsulting.com/Case%20Interviews.htm" target="_blank">case interview</a>. Becoming familiar with both types of interviews, the types of questions asked and how to respond, is essential in becoming a successful hire. 

## How to Use the Calendar

Students interested in a career in consulting can collaborate with other students preparing for either <font color="blue">behavioural interviews</font> (color coded blue) or <font color="red">case interviews</font> (color coded red). It is recommended to commit at least <b>2 hours</b> in total for an interview session - 45 minutes for interviewing and 15 minutes for feedback, for each participant.

#### A) Join an Interview Session
<dl><dd><p>
Review the Calendar below for an interview type, date and time slot in which you are able to act as an interview-lead. Send an invite to the person hosting the session, <a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12804714/9259685/3517af84-41c0-11e5-834f-c281d1be4315.gif " target="_blank">by following these steps.</a></p></dd></dl>

#### B) Host an Interview Session
<dl><dd><p>
If the practice sessions listed on the calendar do not accommodate your schedule or if you are interested in different types of interviews (for example, Management Consulting interviews differ from Technology Consulting), then create your own time slot. <a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12804714/9266601/8b653bb4-4200-11e5-8a65-b3d462c7ddbc.gif" target="_blank"><b>BEFORE adding an event, please follow this link for instructions.</b></a>
