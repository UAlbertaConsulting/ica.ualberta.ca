## Coordinate Practice Interview Sessions

Consulting is an extremely competitive field. Potential candidates often have a strong background in academics, extracurricular activities and work experience. Interviews are conducted by employers to allow candidates to differentiate themselves. Consulting firms often include both a standard, [behavioural interview](https://alis.alberta.ca/ep/eps/tips/tips.html?EK=161) and industry specific, [case interviews](http://www.insideconsulting.com/Case%20Interviews.htm). Becoming familiar with both types of interviews, the types of questions asked and how to respond, is essential to becoming a successful candidate. 

## How to Use the Calendar

Students interested in a career in consulting can collaborate with other students preparing for either behavioural interviews or case interviews.
