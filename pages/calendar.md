## Coordinate Practice Interview Sessions

Consulting is an extremely competitive field. Potential candidates often have a strong background in academics, extracurricular activities and work experience. Interviews are conducted by employers to allow candidates to differentiate themselves. Consulting firms often include both a standard, <a href="https://alis.alberta.ca/ep/eps/tips/tips.html?EK=161" target="_blank">behavioural interview</a> and an industry specific, <a href="http://www.insideconsulting.com/Case%20Interviews.htm" target="_blank">case interview</a>. Becoming familiar with both types of interviews, the types of questions asked and how to respond, is essential in becoming a successful hire. 

## How to Use the Calendar
