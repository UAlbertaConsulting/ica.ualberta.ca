# 2015 Consulting Case Competition

## Details

ICA’s first annual Case Competition is designed to give non-MBA undergraduate and graduate degree candidates a chance to work as a team to solve a case together while demonstrating their analytical, problem solving and presentation skills.

Our Case Competition is a one-day, completely free event that does not require previous business experience or any other specialized knowledge. We highly encourage all University of Alberta students to form teams and apply! 

## Application Rules

Priority will be given to applications received before the end of February 2015.

Teams need to submit one cover letter, a resume for each member, and a short form with background and contact info for all members.  

Please see rules for applying and additional details below. Email us at [ica@ualberta.ca](mailto:ica@ualberta.ca) for questions related to the case competition.
 
- Teams must have 4 or 5 members. Teams must also have a name – feel free to get creative - and a one-page cover letter.
- Everyone is welcome to apply, but there must be at least three non-MBA University of Alberta students per team.
- Please be prepared with the name, email address, program, and resume for each team member.
- Email us at [ica@ualberta.ca](mailto:ica@ualberta.ca) if you have questions.
