## [Consulting Speed Networking Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/1625718124358104/) November 18 - 6:00 to 9:30pm @ BUS 5-04


Do you know how to make an elevator pitch? Have you ever had to introduce yourself, hold a short concise conversation, AND make an impression? If so, this networking session is just for you! Hone your networking skills and broaden your personal network through our first annual ‘Speed Networking’ event with professional consultants and fellow ICA members!

This networking portion of the evening provides students with the opportunity to meet and interact with top consulting professionals. The session will be broken down into several 5-minute intervals, in which students will get to meet and chat with a professional one-on-one, and then rotating to meet the next professional.

We will also be hosting a keynote speaker who will present on leadership and the trends in today's consulting industry. This will be followed by a presentation from ICA executives who will introduce ICA and inform everyone about upcoming events. The remainder of the evening will be open for general networking and socializing. Catering will be provided.

This cross-functional event will include professionals from all practices in consulting, and is an excellent opportunity for graduating students to meet potential employers.
